# Tag content extractor

## Introduction  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è:
The following project is a simple java based application that will extract text between two valid XML tags.

## HackerRank Problem :duck:
In a tag-based language like XML or HTML, contents are enclosed between a start tag and an end tag like <tag>contents</tag>. Note that the corresponding end tag starts with a /.

Given a string of text in a tag-based language, parse this text and retrieve the contents enclosed within sequences of well-organized tags meeting the following criterion:

.Criteria:
. The name of the start and end tags must be same. The HTML code &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h2&gt; is not valid, because the text starts with an h1 tag and ends with a non-matching h2 tag.
. Tags can be nested, but content between nested tags is considered not valid. For example, in &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a&gt;contents&lt;/a&gt;invalid&lt;/h1&gt;, contents is valid but invalid is not valid.
. Tags can consist of any printable characters.
